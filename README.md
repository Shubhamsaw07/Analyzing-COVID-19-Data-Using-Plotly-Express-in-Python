Analyzing COVID-19 Data Using Plotly Express in Python

 I recently worked on a project where I analyzed and visualized global COVID-19 data using Plotly Express in Python. The goal was to explore how the virus spread across different countries and understand the trends through clear, interactive visualizations.
 
 Using three datasets containing country-level statistics, daily case updates, and death-related information, I performed data cleaning, explored key metrics, and built multiple charts including bar graphs, line charts, scatter plots, bubble charts, and choropleth maps.

 These visualizations helped highlight:
Top affected countries
Continent-wise impact
Country-specific trends (like the USA)

 How COVID-19 spread globally from January to July 2020
Plotly Express made it easy to create high-quality, interactive graphs that reveal patterns and insights quickly. This project reinforced how powerful data visualization can be in understanding real-world events and making complex data more accessible.
